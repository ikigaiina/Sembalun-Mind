## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Final Pre-Deployment Validation
1. **Final Build Test**: Execute `npm run build` one final time
2. **Environment Check**: Verify all production environment variables
3. **Security Scan**: Final security rules and headers validation
4. **Performance Test**: Bundle size and loading time verification

### Phase 2: Production Deployment
1. **Vercel Deployment**: Push to production using optimized build
2. **DNS Propagation**: Monitor domain resolution
3. **SSL Certificate**: Verify HTTPS activation
4. **CDN Distribution**: Confirm global edge deployment

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Validation
1. **Functionality Test**: Authentication flows, core features
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Page load times, bundle size
3. **Error Monitoring**: Check for runtime errors
4. **User Experience**: Mobile responsiveness, PWA installation

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

When deployment succeeds, expect:
- **Authentication**: Google Sign-in + Email/Password working
- **User Profiles**: Profile creation and data saving to Firestore
