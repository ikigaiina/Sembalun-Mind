● I can see from the existing codebase that
   we've made tremendous progress on the
  comprehensive account management system
  for Sembalun. The meditation statistics
  component has been fully implemented with
   advanced analytics, trend visualization,
   and personalized insights.

  Looking at the remaining todos, I need to
   continue with implementing the emotional
   intelligence growth tracking system. Let
   me create this service and component to
  complete the analytics suite.

       ervice.ts)
  ⎿ Wrote 1 lines to src\services\emotional
    IntelligenceService.ts
    import {
      collection,

      updateDoc,
      getDocs,
      query,
      where,
      orderBy,
      limit,

● Now let me create the UI component for
  emotional intelligence tracking:

● Write(src\components\analytics\EmotionalI
       ntelligenceTracker.tsx)
  ⎿ Wrote 1 lines to src\components\analyti
    cs\EmotionalIntelligenceTracker.tsx
    import React, { useState, useEffect }
    from 'react';
    import { useAuth } from
    '../../hooks/useAuth';
    import { Button } from '../ui/Button';
    import { Input } from '../ui/Input';
    import { emotionalIntelligenceService,
    EmotionalIntelligenceMetric,
    EIGrowthInsight, EIDevelopmentGoal }
    from '../../services/emotionalIntellige
    nceService';
    interface
    EmotionalIntelligenceTrackerProps {
      className?: string;
    }
